Recently I got into making granola. Much like my infamous bread days, the granola probably isn't as good as the kind you get from the store and Im not sure if it's that much cheaper. But I really enjoy the iterative, almost scientific, method of hypothesizing, testing, eating. After a couple iterations, I finally got a recipe I've tweaked from online ones that results in the crunchy clusters I love, which kind of tastes like cookies.  
    
Andrew's Granola Recipe:  
2 cups oats - I find the smaller cuts of oats in minute cohere than old-fashioned  
1/4 cup oil  
1/4 cup maple syrup or honey  
pinch of salt  
-  
Now here's where it gets interesting. The above ingrediants will make granola, but from here you can throw whatever else you want. I like the following:  
1/8 cup melted dark chocolate - rly helps bind the oats together  
3/4 cup nuts (I use almonds)  
1/4 cup coconut flakes, sweetened or not  
pinch of cinnamon  
1 tsp vanilla extract  
  
1. Mix all ingrediants together  
2. Bake at 300F for 20 min, spread out on pan. No need to pack down  
3. Take out and mix so it cooks evenly. Then, drizzle on top some more honey/maplesyrup before packing the oats down and together. This will help form clumps.  
4. Bake at 250F for 40-60min more. I think cooking it this long lends to crunchier clusters.  
5. Let cool completely before using hard spatula to scrap off bottom. The granola will naturally break off in clusters.
