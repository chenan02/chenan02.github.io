As mentioned in the last post, I kinda got into making bread. I've been looking for a hobby I can do outside of climbing and snowboarding, I guess this can be one of them. This post is to share what I've learned so far.  
  
So first thing's first - the ingrediants. Bread is often made of just 4 ingrediants:  
- Flour  
- Water  
- Salt  
- Yeast  
What makes a ciabatta different from a bagel is the techniques used after combining these. I find that interesting.  
  
Breads that use just these are called lean breads. The other category is "enriched" breads, which means it has some amount of fat content added, like milk or eggs or butter.  
  
This fat content will change the bread to be softer, have a different flavor, and be less airy. Think cakes and stuff. More precisely, the oils will coat the glutenin and gliadin strands to prevent the formation of gluten, which makes the chewy air bubbles in a baguette. more on this later.  
  
Ingrediant Ratios  
Obviously, the ratio of ingrediants will affect the bread that will be developed. The water to flour ratio is called teh Hydration %. Alot of Baguettes and Sandwich breads hover around 60-65%, as in 60 parts water for 100 parts flour. Hydration will affect how your sticky your dough will be and also how open your crumb (the inside) will be - for instance, breads with a very dense crumb like bagels and pretzls have a hydration percentation of ~55%. Ciabatta and Pizzas have ~70-75%.  
  
Salt to yeast ratio will play an effect as well. Salt inhibits yeast growth such that your bread can rise for longer without collapsing on itself and develop more flavors. It also strengths the gluten structures that form. Yeast, of course, are unicellular fungi that eat the glucose and expel carbon dioxide and alcohol (which burns off in baking), which cases bread to rise and give it a deeper flavor. How much yeast you add will be described later.  
  
The Method  
Most recipes call for something along the lines of the following:
0. Preferment 
1. Mix dough
2. Knead
3. Let sit  
4. Shape dough  
5. Let sit ("proofing")  
6. Bake  
  
The Preferment
The first step is optional, but the extra fermentation time gives breads a more complex flavor. Using it is called using the Sponge Method, whereas not is called the Straight Dough method (and the Modified Straight Dough Method for enriched breads). A sponge is essentially just a soupy mix of flour (about 30% of total in recipe) and water and yeast that ferments that you combine with the final dough to give flavor. There're different kinds of Sponges, for instance bigas and poolishes, but they generally use about a 50/50 ration flour to water (for a poolish, drier if biga) and about a 0.15% in weight yeast, more or less depending on how long it ferments. Ferment this for 8-16 hours, depending on schedule.  
  
Mixing  
Simple enough, combine dry ingrediants before the wet. Add most the water while mixing before adding intermittantly. You want it such that the dough no longer stays on the sides. Err on more water than less; a wetter dough will allow the gluten to be more extensible, resulting in larger holes in the crumb.
  
Knead  
Combine the mixed dough with the preferment by pushing the two with heels of hands (be careful not to tear) and fold back on self. I've also seen recipes that pinch the two instead of pushing. This will organize the gluten strands to be stronger, which allows it to keep gas in for bubbles. Repeat until the dough is "springy" - pressing a finger in will cause it to come back.  
  
Rise  
Till dough about double in size. ~2 hours
  
Shape  
Some people "punch" down the dough to release gas bubbles. This distrbutes the yeast to new food sources. I think folding the dough over on itself is supposed to result in a more airy crumb. Shaping will depend on what kind of shape you want. But for a ball, fold the sides of the dough into the center and gently roll the dough on a surface by gently pulling it towards you from the back. Do not squash.  
  
Proofing  
This is the final rise before baking. Cover the dough and let sit until the dough springs back when pressed (~1 hour)  
  
Baking  
Bake seam-side up at about 400F (less if enriched) until the crust is a golden brown. (~30 min)  
  
Enriched Bread  
As hinted above, you can enhance your lean bread by adding other stuff beyond the 4 ingrediants. Fats (butter, oil, egg yolk) will coat the gliadin and glutenin strands to prevent water from getting to them and forming strong gluten strands. This will cause your bread to be more moist, develop a softer crust, and generally have a denser crumb (think cakes). If you want Sugars will feed the yeast and encourage respiration/gas production, as well as giving your bread a sweeter taste and tenderizing the crumb.  
  
The Holy Grail  
As also mentioned in the last post, I was inspired to get into bread after having the Pan de Chocolat while climbing in Colombia. I'm not often struck by my food but this one caused a revelation. The bread wasofter than a baguette, and the crust flexed in your fingers, while being light and airy on the inside. I would liken it to maybe pizza crust, or maybe a dinner roll. Maybe ciabatta. And of course, the globs of chocolate on the inside made it amazing. I still think about it to this day.  
  
So my plan of attack:  
Sponge  
3 cups flour
1.5 cup water 
.25 tsp yeast

Dough
1 cup flour 
.25 cups milk
1 tbsp sugar  
3 tbsp butter  
1.5 tsp salt  
1 tsp yeast
Maybe an egg?
