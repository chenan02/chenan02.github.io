preface: ive been climbing ~3 years at the time of this post. i almost certainly dont need to think this much about training at my level, but it interests me. for my entire climbing life ive "free climbed", or just climbed what i wanted, and have plateaued. i think structured planning can get me to that next level.  
  
i like climbing. i shouldnt have to state a reason for training, but here it is: climbing gets more interesting at higher levels. in my opinion, a clean, 5.13 route is much more awe-inspiring than a juggy 5.10. plus, it opens so many doors.  
  
i firmly believe that most people have the genetic potential to reach 5.13; the time taken to get there differing as a factor of grit. a person who's plateaued at 5.10 for years hasnt reached their potential; there's no way someone can be "bad" for that long. this person simply hasnt stepped out of their comfort zone - no one bumps up a grade knowing they can send it; only by trying something you cannot do will you adapt to be able to do it. the same can be said for a 5.13 climber.  
  
anyways

there are 4 energy systems associated in climbing:  
1. endurance - time you can climb on "easy" holds without getting pumped. suicides.  
2. strength - weight you can support in a static hang. hangboarding.  
3. power - ability to generate force quickly; think dynamic. campusing/bouldering.  
4. power-endurance - number of dynamic moves over time. circuiting.

muscle  
its not that important. that is, you dont need to be able to do 100 pullups or hold an iron cross to climb hard; i certainly dont remember a time when i had to do a straight pullup to the next hold. maybe a lockoff here and there. i once heard that dru mack sent transworld depravity (5.14a) hardly being able to do a pullup. i doubt this is true, but i think relative to technique and finger strength/power, it is a lower necessity until you get to elite levels, and should primarily be used for core stability and injury prevention. that said, it certainly doesnt hurt.  
  
steve bechtel would disagree with me. he also knows much more about climbing than me. here are his benchmarks: <https://www.climbstrong.com/started-lifting-now-what/>  
  
core - this is used for stability in overhangs and tension/balance on slabs. your legs draw directly from the core. aim for dynamic movement - this means NOT planks 
injury prevention - agonist/antagonist balance is key; due to the mostly-pulling nature of climbing, most climbers develop overdeveloped back muscles, which is why we all slouch. one should work the pushing muscles and shoulders to achieve a sturdy, integrated body resistant to so much dynamic movement. dont go overboard such that the muscle weighs you down. also, forearm extensors, because tennis elbow sucks.  
  
exercises can be found in a previous blog post, but here are some good ones:  
- ab rollouts  
- hanging toe-to-bars  
- skin the cat  
- typewriters  
- frenchies  
- bench press

finger strength  
people say you shouldnt focus on finger strength until you boulder ~v6; otherwise, you fastrack your way up grades without attaining the necessary technique. my thought is that this is probably true, but im still gonna train it anyways. i dont want to reach a point where im limited, and then wait several years for my tendons to catch up.  
  
hangboarding  
you probably dont need to hangboard until youve been climbing for at least 3 years or a v6; bouldering will give you the necessary strength while teaching you technique.  
  
there are a few methods, aggregated here: <https://www.climbstrong.com/started-lifting-now-what/>  
  
repeaters, by the anderson bros  
7sec on, 3sec off. 6-10 reps, x sets.  use different grips and enough weight.  
the idea of this is to mimic climbing - studies show climbers are typically on holds for 7 seconds before moving to the next, which takes 3 seconds.  
my view is you might as well just be climbing then, as that will also train technique and hypertroph the forearms on a larger range of holds.  
  
maximum weight, by eva lopez-rivera  
10 sec w max weight, 3 min off.  
this is used to maximize muscle recruitment in the fingers and build muscular-neural connections.  
i see a benefit to this, and i have seen noticable improvements after my first few weeks.

campusing  
i dont do it. neither should you.  
they say that wolfgang gullich invented the campus board to train for action directe, a 15m 5.14d route that is nothing by dynamic moves on monos. if he and others got to that route without a campus board, so can you. its just a sure way to pull a pulley, and bouldering is a better alternative.

setting plans  
its important for improvement. i found tracking just a single variable, finger strength, led to much faster gains, a la incentives/goals to push myself, than without. it honestly surprised me.  
theres a ton of documentation on having micro- and macro-cycles of training that train a specific energy system and yadayada but i think its a little over-the-top and can take away the stoke for climbing. monitoring a few key (and quantifiably measurable) benchmarks is fine, such as finger strength, boulder density, etc.  
here is my plan: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12WKFTKnQFTfGeNnY6Fv-x49Y8V-rAE6pVN4sW3WI9qc/edit?usp=sharing>  
  
my typical week:  
day 1: hard sport, hangboard  
day 2: cracks (this is a "rest" day, assuming no face climbing is done)  
day 3: bouldering, 4x4s  
day 4: rest  
repeat  
  
this is suppemented with morning weight lifting from above.  
true to steve bechtel, i dont exclusively train endurance. i dont agree with him in saying it's not helpful, i just am lazy. i imagine that suicides/circuiting at the end of your session will flush out the lactic acid in the fingers and leave you less sore the next day, but i have little anecdotal evidence supporting that. hugo trained in a bouldering-only gym and climbed 13c, so thats good enough for me.

resting  
this is important. i am much too familiar with overtraining - although i have somehow managed to avoid serious tendon/pulley injury, i have been dogged in the past with tennis elbow. there was a point towards the beginning of my climbing life where just thinking of climbing sent pulses down to my fingertips. not a good position to be in.  
  
it is better to undertrain than overtrain - the last thing you want is to set yourself back with a popped pulley, and have recurrent issues because youre too impatient to let it heal. rest AT LEAST every other day. also, gentle reminder that your body gets stronger when you rest, not when your train.
