Andrew's Omnibus of Climbing Training - 2019

1. Energy Systems

This concept was first coined by Eric Horst. In general, it means that your muscles use different energy sources to supply different levels of intensity. Scientifically, he suggests that there are three systems your body uses:

a) Anaerobic Alactic - in scientific terms, this means that phosphagen breaks down to replenish the ATP in the muscle. In laymen's terms, this results in maximal power (>95%) for a very short amount of time (<10s). In climbing terms, this is bouldering.

b) Anaerobic Lactic - Glycogen is replenishing ATP; this is "strength-endurance" effort (80-95%) for a slightly longer time (10-120s). In climbing terms, this is linking many hard moves on your project.

c) Local Aeroric - Mitochondrial Respiration - your body is preforming efficiently, at a lower intensity (<80%) for a long time (>120s). In climbing terms, this is easy climbing and resting (read: recharging the other systems for more try-hard).

In the present day, most training plans are revolving around this concept to increase the capacity of each system - the stronger your muscles, the more intensity they can output within these given times/systems. 

2. Hypertrophy vs Recruitment

There are two ways to get physically stronger: Hypertrophy and Recruitment.
Hypertrophy is breaking down your muscles and RESTING to build them larger than before. Recruitment is stimulating your motor neurons to generate a larger contractile strength.
You build bigger muscles (hypertrophy) by doing lower intensity workouts with higher repetitions. 
You activate more motor neurons (recruitment) by doing higher intensity workouts with lower repeitions.
It often makes sense to build muscle before recruiting said newfound muscle; as such, you'll see that strength phases often come before power phases in a periodized plan (see below).
NOTE: You do not get "too big" by doing high intensity workouts! Because you are targeting the neural system, not muscle catabolism. 

Higher/lower repetitions seems easy enough, but what about "intensity"? This can mean anything related to the level of effort you're putting in. One cannot talk about intensity without bringing in the terms "strength" and "power". People understandably get them mixed up because they are related words - power is simply the amount of strength over a period of time. Depending on your method of intensity you could work to increase either - maximal weight (think max hangs and slow-twitch fibers) will increase your strength, while quick motions (think campusing and fast-twitch fibers) will increase your power. While not exactly the same, both will increase your level of recruitment (and therefore your alactic capacity) and you should sprinkle both variations in your workouts.

3. Periodization
It follows that one can and should work these separately, as doing both in the same workout will 1) exhaust your body beyond repair and 2) be inefficient, as you would be attempting to recruit muscles you havent even built. Therefore, training should follow cycles, where one works lower intensity, high rep exercises targeting the Alactic energy system, then higher intensity, low rep excersies targeting the lactic energy system. The idea is to increase your capacity in one energy system per period while maintaining the others; by the end, the "average" capacity will be increased. 

How long are these periods? I've found that about 1 month is a good time; shorter and you're not diving deep enough to make improvements; longer and you start seeing diminished returns (and boredom). However, feel free to experiment with different period lengths to find what balances your results and ability to focus.

3. Work motions, not muscles
We want our workouts to be functional. I don't know about you, but I go to the gym to get stronger, not to look bigger. Therefore, it doesn't make sense for me to "work biceps". If I want to train my body to get stronger in the real-world parallel, it makes sense that I practice progressively resistive, similar motions. Doing so will also trigger motor learning - where your muscles "learn" to do motions they are not used to doing through neurological adaptaions during practice. For example, when I first tried to perform a Skin the Cat, I struggled there, willing my shoulders to rotate but couldn't do a single one. After working at it over a month or so, I was able to do 10 in a row. This quick improvement suggests that it wasn't that I wasn't strong enough to do the motion; rather, my muscles were not "used" to the movement.

Furthermore, when people do "core", I see too many people just doing a ton of sit-ups, maybe followed by weighted pull-downs. These exercises are working the same flexion movement! You might as well be doing one twice, or even better, with more weight. For a robust core, you need to move in every dimension.

Enter the acronym FIRE - flexion, isometric, rotational, extension. This is an acronym I heard about recently here: https://mtntactical.com/knowledge/evolution-chassis-integrity-theory/ (in the article they actually dump FIRE in favor of a more integrated workout, but that's for a different topic). I had thought about this separately and would make some tweaks, but I like the catchiness. The idea is, instead of just a flexion exercise, one should vary their movements by adding in exercises that resist flexion (isometric, think planks), that rotate the core or resist rotation (think wood chops) and extend the lower back (think deadlifts). I would add in a side motion, like side raises, but overall I think it is a good concept.

In climbing, this translates to the fact that climbing should always take priority over isolation exercises (ie hangboarding, campusing); the intensity is what you should be adjusting. Isolation exercises are simply there to supplement climbing if you see that aspect as a weakness (hint: it probably isnt).

An example 3-month plan

Month 1 - Hypertrophy
Sun: Lead climb; repeaters on hangboard
Mon: Core - 4x12 ankle touches, 4x12 lower back extension, 4x12 ab rollouts, 4x12 side raises
Tue: Lead climb; repeaters on hangboard
Wed: Antagonists - bench press, dips, overhead press, IsYsTs
Thur: Lead climb; repeaters on hangboard
Fri: Agonists - frenchies, typewriters, rows, shrugs
Sat: Rest or easy ARCing or "movement workshop" - front lever progressions, dragonflag progression, etc

Month 2 - Recruitment - Strength
Sun: Boulder; max hangs
Mon: Core - 4x5 weighted pulldown, 4x4 deadlift, 4x10s bridge, 4x4 side raises
Tue: Boulder; max hangs
Wed: Antagonists - same
Thur: Boulder; max hangs
Fri: Agonists - bent one-arm hangs, max weighted frenchies, max rows, skin the cat
Sat: Rest or easy ARCing or movement

Month 3 - Recruitment - Power
Sun: Boulder; campus
Mon: Core - quick weighted back ext
Tues: Boulder
Wed Antagonists - same
Thur: Boulder; campus
Fri: Agonsts - clap pullups, quick rows, etc
Sat: Rest or easy ARCing or movement

Notice that the individual exercises are not the same. This is on purpose, as I believe that rotating through exercises routinely allows for greater returns in motor learning before plateaus.

Obviously, you should adapt these concepts to make a training plan of your own to suit your own needs and goals. My body is particularly adept at endurance, so it makes more sense for me to be working on the strength and power side of things.

4. Rest!
Possibly the most important point. I know you've heard it before, but I'm going to scream it one more time: YOUR BODY GETS STRONGER RESTING!!! I know you think you can handle more. And that you've seen all the Nike ads and pros' instagrams telling you to work harder. And that's certainly true during a session. But after leaving the gym, take AT LEAST 48 hours before hitting the same muscles. 

I've been there. From my own experience climbing and lifting, I've thought that I could push my body harder than most. But after years of consecutive climbing days and pushing my body over the limit, all I've come out with is regret, as I'm 100% positive I would be at least as strong as I am today, though most likely stronger, if I had spent half the time doing what I did. So for your own time and energy, stay home and just CHILL.

5. Track your progress
I don't do this enough. But if I were to guess as to how people seem to leap through the grades and plateaus, this would be it. The few periods I recorded my workouts I saw the biggest gains; it really seems like a cheat code to fast-track your progress. Be sure to note not just your actions, but also your goals and conditions each session. How did you feel before and during the workout? How much weight are you planning on adding today? Doing so will keep you honest by 1) telling you to rest when you don't feel strong and 2) reminding you to up the intensity when you do feel strong.

6. Diet
I can and have written a whole post on this. Cut out the junk food. Cut out the soda. Add in more veggies. Educate yourself on nutrition; be weary of fad diets and analyze what may or may not work.
