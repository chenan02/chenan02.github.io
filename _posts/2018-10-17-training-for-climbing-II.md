A year in review. 

It's October 2018, which means it's been a little more than a year since I moved to DC and started a regular, 10-6 weekend warrior schedule. I think my only goal was to get to the New AMAP, and I say I've done that. Almost every weekend, from February to November. Making attainable goals. Go me. 
 
I think I made the same mistake as my time at the Red, just trying to onsight everything. I shouldn't say mistake - it's been awesome getting so much exposure - but I told myself I'd start projecting some routes I could really push myself on. This has been a little difficult bumming rides off other people, but now I have a car and a steady partner, so it's time to get to work! 
 
Some of my prouder ascents this past year: 
- Check Your Grip, 12a, onsight 
- Toxic Hueco, 11d, 2nd go 
- Breakfast at Koops, 11d, 2nd go 
- The Infidel, 11d, 2nd go 
- Abiyoyo, 12b, 5? goes!!! 
 
As far as training goes, I've been learning alot. I don't really have a structured program, but the way my psyche shifts from lead to bouldering follows roughly a periodized schedule. For a while I kept track of my finger-strength gains and saw huge benefits, but after plateauing I stopped keeping track. I could certainly benefit from tracking and goal-setting though. 
 
Background: 
My work gives me the luxury of free, well-balanced meals, and also a late start for plenty of time to work out beforehand. Given these ideal conditions, I should be sending 13s in no time, right? 
 
Not really. Out of habit, I work out 4x/week for an hour and a half, mostly because, as an early-riser, I have nothing better to do. 
 
For the first few months, my schedule looked something like this: 
Mon/Wed - Core/antagonists day: 
  - Warm up: V-ups 
  - cable pull-down 
  - side bends 
  - hanging leg lifts 
  - windshield wipers 
  - ring rollouts 
  - dumbbell press 
  - cable flys 
  - overhead press 
 
Tue/Thu - Climbing specific day: 
  - warmup: lat pulldown/reverse fly 
  - weighted pullups 
  - weighted frenchies 
  - typewriters 
  - skin-the-cats 
  - curls 
  - pickup rows 
  - uneven pullups 
  - deadlift 
 
Including climbing 4 days a week. "Dude, isn't that alot of abs and lats?" You ask. And I would've replied, "Yes, but if I want to climb harder than everyone I have to train harder than everyone." This actually worked all right - I plateaued at around 50 lbs of hanging weight for my max pullups, and went from like. 2 leg lifts a set to 10. I felt a noticable gain in body tension on overhung routes and roofs. As someone who eschewed pullups his whole life, I was feeling pretty good about myself. 
 
But not good for long. After working at my plateau for a couple months, my body began to burn out mid-week - I would come in Wednesday, out of habit, sore and not able to pull nearly as much as my Monday session. I felt unmotivated and dragged out my sets. I felt my climbing waning. 
 
I once read an article from Steve Bechtel, a huge advocate for lifting for climbing. For all his advocating, he warns, Remember that you're a climber who lifts, not a lifter who climbs. I felt that I was falling under this trap, though I justified it with numbers such as his own here: https://www.trainingbeta.com/weight-lifting-guidelines-with-steve-bechtel/, where he recommends to work up to somthing like 75% of body weight for pullups. Let's step back and do the math. I weigh about 140lbs, so to meet that mark I would hang more than 100lbs off me. That's absurd! Yet I was so far from that guideline that I continued to press on. 
  
Eventually, I turned it down to a "more manageable" schedule:  
Mon: Antagonists  
Tue: Abs + deadlift - climb later  
Wed: Agonists  
Thu: Abs - climb later  
(climb weekends)  
 
Despite hitting the non-core groups only once a week, I didn't notice a decrease in strength. Certainly not an increase, but I figure that I'm already stronger than most climbers at my level; my physical strength is certainly not a weakness for these routes. Even this schedule is quite taxing; because I'm still spending 1.5 hours in the gym, I'm working only shoulders and chest for that entire time, for instance. Heavy shoulder shrugs seem to comepletely wreck me for the next few days; I need to learn to not always go 100% my entire time, or just get in later.  
 
This seems to be more sustainable. I'm wondering if working out every day takes away from recovering from climbing - given a limited amount of "recoverability", am I unnecessarily stealing some from my fingers to direct towards other muscles? I plan to limit my workouts to an hour each, as more of a "maintanence" level. 
 
The bottom line is, I am still more than strong enough to send a high level, and I have not seen breakthrough gains from working out. True, I am sending than harder before, but I am not convinced that is due to extra fitness verses just climbing longer. I believe that more valuable is the "adaptation phase" of a workout - from the time you begin working a new movement to the moment you plateau, your body learns and grows better that movement, whether physically or neurologically. This can be seen as when I was not able to do a single skin the cat at first, but soon progressed to 6 at a time. I believe that adapting and getting stronger at a wider range of movements, as opposed to maintaining a high level of a single movement, is where the benefits towards climbing lies.
