fats
Fat is a slow-burning energy source. There are 3 kinds of fats: saturated, unsaturated, and trans (partially hydrogenated) The difference among them lies in the chemical structure - saturated is saturated with hydrogren atoms, leading to only single bonds, whereas unsaturated contains double. Due to this, saturated fat is solid at room temperature (think bacon fat) whereas unsaturated is liquid (think olive oil). The bad rep fat receives stems from saturated and trans fats - these increase your LDL cholesterol, which causes plaque to build up in arteries, which leads to heart disease. Unsaturated fats have been shown to be good for you, and these carry the LDL cholesterol to the liver, lowering your plaque buildup. So yes, fat IS an essentially and healthy part of your diet, but know which kind you are eating.
