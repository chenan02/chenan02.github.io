so I'm going to take back everything that I've said about training for climbing.  
  
Coronavirus has given Steph and I the opportunity to live at the New River Gorge, which has been awesome for outdoor climbing but has taken away our opportunities for any "real" training at a gym, normal or climbing.  
  
And that's fine.  
  
More than fine, actually. Since we moved here I've seen my grades shoot up and feeling stronger than ever. And while some of that can be attributed to us actually hopping on a route more than once for once, the fact still remains that I wasn't progressing this quickly on the gym routes. I think I'm just climbing /better/ nowadays.  
  
Previously I, like so many other gym rats, focused way too on metrics. Hangboard times. Pull up weights. Ab wheel reps. Those physical quantities you can measure and increase. I used to do strength workouts every day and climbing seshions every other. It got to the point where I would feel bad skipping a session, even if I was sore. But now that I've been removed from that, I don't feel any weaker.  
  
I never understood looking at pro training schedules and seeing how little they do. "Every other day? They must sandbag it so mortals like us dont copy that and overtrain", I thought. Such a high level of fitness must need a high level of conditioning for maintenance, right? But as I learned here, 1) it takes a surprisingly small amount of conditioning to maintain the your strength and 2) physical strength is pretty non-applicable to climbing. I've been quite bad at doing core workouts here in Fayetteville, and while I'm not pretending my abs were as dashing as they used to be, I haven't noticed any significant drops in my ability to create tension on a route. And while I've hardly done a pull-up since I've arrived, I haven't not been able to make the lockoffs I need to do.  
  
We always hear about how the best way to train for climbing is to just climb. And yet I feel like a large proportion of climbers actually follow that. We're always looking for the silver bullet, the "one cool trick that will improve your climbing!". Yet c4hp did a post that shows training core in isolation is pretty much useless for climbing. I wouldn't be surprised if that could be extended to pull-ups, deadlifts, etc. Anecdotally, my experience supports that.  
  
I'm not saying not to strength condition. There's no doubt that strengthening is the best form of prehab, for instance. If you want to condition for health, that's great. Tangentially, I think there is a baseline at which you should be to climb harder; if you can't do a single pull-up, you may need to catch that up before climbing roofs. But I believe that a vast majority of climbers meet that benchmark, and are therefore overexerting themselves by training further. It's not just a waste of time, but a waste of "recovery" - a non-scientific resource that I just came up with that describes your body's ability to recover your more essential climbing muscles.
  
Previously, I believed that you needed to condition your body for the next level before you can climb at the next level. But this robs you of the process of finding sneaky beta, trusting bad feet, and just in general learning to move well. We all know several gym bros who smash through the pink one in the corner without putting their foot on. After climbing with several of those guys, I believe the opposite is true: learn to climb better with the conditioning you have, then hit the gym if needed. Because let's be honest, you've never fallen off a route because you weren't able to do a pull-up.  
  
If I were to make a workout now, it would look something like Brian Suntay's from the Training Beta Podcast (https://www.trainingbeta.com/brian-suntay-an-offseason-route-climbing-training-program/). The focus would be less climbing, less conditioning, more intensity:  
Sun: Climb - strength/power endurance (circuits, lead, hangboard)  
Mon: Rest  
Tue: Climb - power (Limit boulder, board, campus, etc)  
Wed: Rest  
Thur: Condition/rest (antagonists, maybe deadlifts, ab wheel, one-arm lockoffs)  
Fri: Climb - whatever your weakness is. For me, it's power  
Sat: Rest  
  
I think most people feel good climbing 3-4 times a week, or every other day. After not climbing that frequently living at the New and still progressing, I think it's more optimal to have more rest at 3 days max, especially if I'm giving it all during my sessions. Similarly, I think it's important to prioritize rest, hydration, and diet. Stop "burning out" on the hangboard till gym close! I used to do that and wouldn't get back home till midnight, and getting maybe 5 hours of sleep a night. You're just robbing yourself! Retire when your power drops (this could be like 2 hours. NOT when youve pumped yourself to failure), drink a protein shake, and get at least 8 hours of sleep. I promise you'll get stronger even if you don't feel sore the next day. 
  
fin.
