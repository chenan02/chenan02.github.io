The following are exerpts from my journal while backpacking south america:

6/10 Colca Canyon  
It starts with convesation. Introducting myself. And this conversation starts with self-confidence. Self-love. Not the ability to be comfortable in the uncomfortable, but rather the ability to be comfortable with everything. That is, the same same as abilishing the notion of "comfort" altogether.  

I am not saying comfort without others is bad. You need both. And it all comes back to self-love - will you have enough self-confidence to throw yourself out there? History says that doing so yields better experiences.

Manuel the bartender  
I sit at the bar, alone. I make conversation with the bartender. He is interesting. He tells me he is Jamaican, lived in Puerto Rico, and learned to speak English, German, etc through various jobs and people he met. He plans to next go to Taiwan or Thailand and learn the language there.  

It made me think - constant change leads to constant improvement. If he hadn't had all these different experiences - if he hadnt been comfortable with all these differing environments - he would not have learned these languages, skills, and would not be able to do what he loves most - travel and ang out in Colca Canyons.  
  
He does it alone.  
  
It made me consider what makes me "comfortable", what built up this mentality that such a life is bad, impossible, or irresponsible. I think it goes back to my upbringing as a child, I as taught that you need to go to college, work the same job, and save for retirement, or else you'll be a failure.  
  
I want to abolish those promonitions.  
  
He probably wasnt raised that way. Butwho is happier?

6/12 - Puno/Lake Titicaca  
Im on a boat in the middle of Lake Titicaca. I was just introduced to the people of the Uros floading islands.  
  
They live a simple life.  
  
They are happy.  
  
One thing that was interesting was they have 1 greeting and 1 reply. "Good day". Kaweelee. "I am great". They are always great, for how can they not be? In a life of catching fish, sewing clothes, and greeting tourists, theyve eliminated all causes of sadness.  
  
They also live by 3 mantras: 1) dont lie 2) dont steal 3) dont be lazy. They adhere to no government It is a good life - they are moral, happy people.  
  
I hope to learn from them.

6/17 Salkantay Trek, Day 3 - Lucmabamba  
There was a french couple working at one of the coffee farms I met today. Although I only talked w/ them for about an our, it was one of the most meaningful conversations thus far.  
  
After giving me a tour and showing me the steps of making coffee, they explained how they were literally hiking the Salkantay Trek, passed by the coffee farm, asked if they could work/WOOF here, there, and started in the middle of their 3-month trip.  

I believe they're taking a year off? and ere for 3 months, after this they want to go to a cacao farm. I can go on about the spontaneity of this couple/going w/ the flow, but I also want to say this: the more people I meet, the more my view of "success" is breaking down.  
[...]  
The world is a big place - too big to stay in one place. I want to go out of my bubble and see what else is out there. For instance, after only a week here Ive realized how freaking luxurious/complex lives Americans live. Our world of smartphones, facebook, relationships, etc is overwhelming compared to the simple lives here. It's so unnecessary and causes so much complexity/stress/drama. We need to learn from the people here; when you live w/ less luxuries, no signal, no hot showers, no electricity, you focus on the things that really matter.  
  
And they are happy.

21 June Lima  
[...]  
A boy who has been watching us offers to teach/play a game. I accept again. With his help, I win.  
  
His name is Cristhan. He is 18 years old.  
  
He is in Lima alone, working to bring his family out of Venezuela, where Chaez rules.  
  
It dawns on me just how privileged I am. Here I am playing chess with a Venezuelan refugee, who works at UNICEF by day and goes home to cook whatever he can afford in his apartment alone.  
  
I am sitting here currently in my s/44 hostel, where Chainsmokers blare to the kids playing beer pong on the roof.  
  
I feel sick.

27 June 2017: Huaraz, Plaza de Armas  
I'm sitting on  bench in the central plaza of Huaraz. Even at 4:30pm on a Tuesday, so many people here! People in South America really take it slow; it seems funny to think that you wouldnt see this many people just sitting around in the US. To enjoy a simple life, away from your laptop or smartphone. To sit for no reason; to live for no reason.  
  
I just came from a 4-day trek - Laguna 69 and the Santa Cruz, both again would do again. I was thinking - why do I hike? To put myself through crackers & shitty peanut butter, cold nights, and deflating pads?  
  
And I think: the higher the pass, the better the view.

16 July 2017 - Restaurant in Suesca  
Dont be a dumbass. Dont be a dumbass.   
This is the mantra of the day as I chill and resist the urge to check out the crags or bike around.  
[...]  
Talking to him reminded me yet again how beautiful the sport of climbing is - beautiful because it most definitely isnt a sport at all but rather a lifestyle. A practice. An art.  
  
He as saying how in climbing you need to not only be strong, but be smart. Smart not only in technique/reading the rock, but understanding your abilities, when to commit, when to downclimb, how to downclimb. I think I'm very dumb in this last climbing smart -- as a gym rat/gumby who always stick clips the first bolt, a deck was waiting to happen. But the important part is to stay positive and recover from this setback.  
  
And that's one of the beauties of climbing - it tests not just your strength and technique, but trains also your consciousness. Mindfullness on the wall. Memory in project. Staying positive when you fall or get injured. Being self-aware of your abilities and your positioning. Recovering from setbacks.  
[...]  
he doesnt plan to move anytime soon - he's right where he loves to be. His job, his play, his aspirations, what he saves money for - all climbing. I think that's so beautiful.  
  
And while I dont have to commit my life to the sport, I hope to be as passionate about anything as he is climbing. Already the sport has brought me literally all over the world, places where I otherwise have no motivation to go. People, an amazing community where I feel sae and comfortable taht inspire me who I otherwise wouldnt meet. Dreams that I wouldnt otherwise have; there's a reason I find myself spending hours watching videos or listing out dream routes.  
[...]  
Today I was looking for water. I come to a shop and tried to buy some, but realized I was sort on money. [...] This dude bougt my water - without knowing if he'd find me again [...] Be that guy. Little acts of kindness stay with you and the peorson, maybe they'll write about it. But for less than a dolalr that man made my day and reconfirmed the Colombian hospitality. It's just doing your part to create the world you want to live in and be the person you want to be.

23 July 2017 - Simon Bolivar Park, Cartegena  
This morning I had breakfast with Theresa and Erica. Theresa was a Michigander web developer-turned0yoga teacher. She tells me before the switch she was doing 70-80 hour weeks as a contractor, often sitting in corners of various companies, never really talking to people.  
[...]  
I mention this because this sounds amost like the path I head down. I romanticized contact work so much, I didnt realize its drawbacks. Yea, you get to travel and have your own hours, but it make sense that youre often an outsider. Teams wont talk to you bc you dont have a team. It could be lonely.  
  
And who knows, maybe I'll still go down this path & burn out. Theresa said she never really planned on becoming a yoga instructor. It happened when she took a trip to India and spontaneously decided to take a certification course. Now it's her life. It's so funny to see where life takes you, but you just have to be open.  
  
So maybe I wont be a programmer, or even in the tech industry, for the rest of my life. And that's fine.  
  
You have dreams. Remember that those are what's important - what you work for, what gives your life meaning. Don't spend you life working up to your dreams without realizing them.  
[...]  
If I ever find myself losing interest, I have to understand that's okay. There are other passions I have. Other life courses. Don't get struck in the track thinking you are "supposed" to be this because you have invested so much time. Look at mom & pharmacy now. ot good.  
  
You only have one life. A finite amount of time. One pair of eyes. Cut your losses when you need to, and make the most of it.

Dream: reture & open a climber's campgound.  
  
A safe space, like Miguel's. Where people meet. "The place" to go for the crag. Make new friends.  
  
Everything about this campground should be directed towards spontaneous meetings. Open spaces. No wifi? A campfire. No climbing buddy? We'll announce that and find you one. Or maybe just use a pin board. Either way it should be open, non-political, non-discriminatory place where people of all interests, backgrounds can get together through climbing. Are you a refugee? A convict? Burnt out of your job? No problem, come to this little island and feel no worries.  
  
To be called "The Miguel's of __ " would be an honor.

25 July 2015 - Cartegena Airport  
[...]  
As the trip draws to a close, I have to ask myself: Did I come out a better person? Did I see what I wanted to see? Did I change at all?  
  
I like to think so. Especially the first month in Peru I had a lot of time to reflect, redefine what "success" and "happiness" mean to me; reorient my life goals accordingly; bring to the forefront a more structured path to growth; focus on focusing and self-awareness; reiterate subjects I want to pursue in the coming years. Ive become more capable, more flexible, and 100% more grateful for things I have taken for granted. In many ways, my inner Q has taken a boost.
