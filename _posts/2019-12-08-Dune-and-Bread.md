Update for December 2019

Things are cooling down, both at work and out. It's that in-between time of year where I've officially called it "cold" outside for climbing, and snow hasn't packed down for snowboarding. A time for rest.  
  
I'm bored.  
I'm not really a creature of rest, at least not lately. Years ago I would've died to have time to happily plug into the computer games and whittle the time away, eyes glued to screen. But since I've gotten into climbing, every weekend not being outdoors is a weekend wasted. What a change.  
  
So here I am, sitting in on a Sunday. A recent hobby I got into is making bread, and not the money kind unfortunately. Really, I've only done it twice so far but I find it interesting to read and tweak my recipes. I like the artisanal aspect of it, how it takes a fine-tuned technique. Also, how the ingredients are cheap and non-perishable.  
  
I got insiration from a bread I ate while climbing in Colombia, at a climbing hostel called El Refugio la Roca, in La Mojarra. This is a hostel done right, with little cabins built into the cliffside, an abundance of hammocks, and a yoga studio, among the basic necessities. But the best thing about the place was the Pan de Chocolat.  
  
This artisanal chocolate chunk bread was crazy. I still think about it do this day. The perfect mixture of airy, crusty soft bread with generous pools of dark chocolate. Man.  
  
The first bread I made looked awesome. Followed the recipe to a T and came out stunning. Exactly what I would expect at a bakery, if I do say so myself. But it wasn't the same. It was too dense; I didn't want a bread that you would serve at dinner and spread butter on, I wanted a desert that a kid would be savoring on a cold winter day.  
  
Reading up on it, I decided to switch from a "lean" dough to a more "rich" dough; one that would have more fats in it to tenderize the fibers. So I replaced the water in the first recipe with soymilk and added butter shavings when folding. The resulting bread came closer to what I wanted, but was poorly executed - I had accidentally used cold milk in the dough, inhibiting the yeast from growing, and therefore resulted in very dense knots. The flavor was creamier, which was nice, and the butter shavings allowed segments to be pulled apart, like in pull apart bread. However, the bread that didn't receive the butter still remained tough.  
  
With these in mind, I'll make the following modifications next time:  
More yeast - and warm milk. Previously I have used a biga, which is a "pre-dough" with little yeast that you allow to ferment before adding to it. Essentially it gives the bread more depth in flavor given the more time fermenting. I want bigger bubbles in the bread to give a more airy texture; this will have to be supported by stronger gluten stands.  
Butter - this is an experiment. Supposely, fats will coat the glutenin and giladin molecules, preventing strong gluten strands from forming, so I'm not sure how this will work. But I do want a softer texture in the strands. 
More water - a more hydrated bread will result in a more open crumb.
  
Ok next  
I just finished reading Dune, by Frank Herbert. Dune is a book I had eyed for a while - the cover looks sweet and the shape of the book draws the eye (see a pic and you'll know what I'm saying) - but have been very much intimidated due to its thickness. The thing is 800 pages long! But on our way back from climbing in Indian Creek I bought the book and it's taken me about a month to read, off and on.  
  
I'll start with the good. I love this book. Except for the cons I'll get to. I love how you can tell Mr. Herbert spent a huge amount of consideration for the world of Dune; the organization dynamics make sense, the characters are flushed out, the technology makes sense. He even devotes Afterwords to the ecology and Religion on Dune. I also love the prose - beautiful enough that you can marvel while reading, functional enough to paint a picture. Doesn't bog down the storyline, like I think it did in The Handmaid's Tale. The symbolism and philosophy are rich, and there's plenty to take away from this book that are still applicable to today. In fact, I had a hard time believing that Dune was published in 1965, before Stars Wars, before Star Trek, or anything really in its scope, with the exception of the Lord of the Rings.  
Now for the bad.  
The ending SUCKED! Spoiler alert. It was as if Herbert got tired of writing, decided to wrap everything up quickly in one last chapter, but then got too tired of even doing that, so he just ended it mid chapter. I mean, the book literally ends mid-conversation. I imagine many people, not just myself, flipped to the next page and saw a big AFTERWORDS. (search google for "what's up with ending of dune").  
  
I hear he structured the book to be like sex - slow start, exciting middle, abrupt ending. If so, this isnt even sex, this is just straight blue balling. 700 pages of beautiful flow and character develop, suddenly everything becomes 1-dimensional, the good guy beats the bad guy, the end. I've also heard that he did this intentionally to leave the reader wanting more - I can understand that from an open-ended ending but geez. This one left a bad taste in my mouth, no need for more.  
  
Anyways. I'd give a 4.5/5 for the first 700 pages and a 0 for the last bit, averaging to a 4/5. Well worth the journey, but don't expect to end satisfied.  
  
Next up on the book list: Hangdog Days by Jeff Smoot. A climbing book gift from Steph!
