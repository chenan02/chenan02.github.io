This fall I drove to the Red or the New almost every weekend. For the red, 9 hours; the new, 5. That's alot of podcasts.  
I listen to mostly the Training Beta Podcast, hosted by Neely Quinn, and the Power Company Podcast, hosted by Kris Hampton. Most of the episodes are meh, but the following are a few nuggets I've gleamed:

- Goal-oriented training  
- Energy systems: climbing demands "marathons" just as it does "sprints", and you train for these differently. http://www.powercompanyclimbing.com/blog/2016/8/31/episode-10-energy-systems-training-with-eric-horst and https://www.trainingbeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1.-Alex-Barrows-Training-Doc-V2-for-training-beta.pdf  
- Periodization (or not): designing your training plans to exclusively work one system at a time, and over time you will see general gains. https://www.trainingbeta.com/media/steve-bechtel-3/  

My thoughts  
While I'm sure some methods may work better for different people, I think that the most important components across any training program are the following - Intensity, Adaptation, and of course, Proper Rest.

Intensity  
A wise man once said, "Don't half ass two things. Whole ass one thing." Similarly, I think a half-assed workout would be better spent as a rest day. This came from the realization that DELTA TIME DOESNT MEAN SHIT! You can boulder or lead or hangboard for years, but if you're doing the same intensity as you were yesterday, you're gonna continue doing so. This solves my continuous question - "I keep bouldering, but I'm not getting stronger". No shit, Sherlock. You're doing the problems you can do, as opposed to pushing your limits. To help with this, I've found keeping a record and setting progressive goals helps.

Adaptation  
The body adapts to a change in stimulus. Just as impoortant as progressive overload is the variance of exercises. I've seen this motor learning in my gym exercises: when first attempting skin the cats, I couldnt do a single one. After working at it for a couple weeks, I could do maybe 6 of them. My body didnt get 6 times stronger; it simply learned a new movement pattern. In Eric Horst's book, he details two further neurological adaptations: motor unit synchronization and disinhibiation. Basically, training your fibers to work in a unified effort and raising the ceiling of your brain's natural inhibitors to try hard. I think that switching up your exercises just as you begin to plateau (about 3 weeks for me) will result in optimal results.

Proper Rest  
Climbers are really bad at this one. It took me 4 years to realize I overtrain, and I'm still falling to the temptation/disillusion of thinking I can cheat the system and "train harder". This is bullshit. I'm sorry, but unless you're the .0001% that can climb 5.14 within the first year, you're not special and you probably need more rest days. You've probably heard it a million times but here it is again: your body's adaptations happen DURING REST; cutting this short will only cheat yourself and cause you to climb worse. This year, I smashed my plateau only when I started to refuse to climb consecutive days. Trust me, I did not feel weaker at all; on the contrary, I now have more time and sending way harder than ever before.

Putting this into a training plan  
I don't have the attention span necessary to hangboard for 6 weeks straight. I'll admit that when I was forced to do so following an ankle injury, I saw leaps and bounds in finger strength. But barring that, I want to climb. 
On the contrary, I don't think that the non-linear method that Steve Bechtel proposes maximizes the adaptation part of the climb; I think that it takes about 2 weeks of progressive overloading to really see gains from a single exercise. I think I'll try to follow the "Conjugate" periodization method above, where you focus on one thing per cycle and maintain the others. The biggest thing that I'm tracking is the QUALITY of each session, which I track here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13F2tLYT4GnAlkZwKh46kimT18WSYhqCVpzKB_e8hmzo.
