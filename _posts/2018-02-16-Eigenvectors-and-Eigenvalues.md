Mathematically:  
  
Av = lv  
  
ex:  
[ 1 2 0 ] [ 1 ]   [ 3 ]    [ 1 ]  
  2 1 0     1   =   3    3   1  
  0 0 -3    0       0        0  
                    ^eigenvalue  
            ^eigenvector    ^

The eigenvectors of a matrix M are vectors that, when you apply M, aren't rotated, only stretched by some vector (the eigenvalue). In other words, the eigenvectors of matrix M have a common orientation in both the transformed and untransformed grids. Because of this, it becomes natural to express new vectors in a grid transformed by M, in terms of eigenvectors.

In an xy-plane, vectors are often described in terms of unit vectors (1,0) and (0,1). When vectors in xy are transformed, calucations in the new context are simplified by using eigenvectors as the new unit vector.
