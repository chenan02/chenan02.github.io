Personal Finance 102 (or, How to be Tax-Efficient)  
  
As said in Personal Finance 101, it seems like taxes are the bane of the FIRE community. I never really thought about taxes before the last couple weeks, but I figured that it would be good to become savvy so I'm not completely clueless when filling out my return. A couple of concepts before we dive in:  
  
Income Tax: Income is taxed at a marginal rate, which means that your money is taxed as if it were filling seperate buckets. So in 2020 if you have $100,000 of taxable income, you would owe 10% on the first $9875, then 12% of dollars 9875 - 40125, 22% of dollars 40125 - 85525, and 24% of dollars 85525 - 100000. So what you owe = (.10 * 9875 + .12 * (40125-9876) + .22 * (85525 - 40126) + .24 * (100000 - 85526)) = $18080. Note: as you can see, not all of your income is taxed at your highest bracket.  
  
Capital Gains Tax: Tax you pay on investment gains, whether it's land that has appreciated, stocks, etc. There are two kinds - short-term and long-term. Assets sold within a year of purchase are subject to short-term tax and are included in your income as the income tax above. Long-term capital gains tax are applied to gains from assets held longer than a year and are taxed depending on how much taxable income you have: 0% if you make between $0-$40000, 15% if %40000-$441450, and 20% if above. As you can see, the rate is lower long-term, so it's to your advantage to hold your assets for at least a year. 401ks and IRAs aren't subject to these, which is why people love them so much.    
  
Deductions: subtractions you can make from your taxable income when paying taxes. i.e, the standard deduction for single filers in 2020 is $12400, which means you can make 40125+12400=52525 before your money starts being taxed at 22% as opposed to 12%. These can also come from contributions to traditional IRAs, charitable donations, etc.

Ok. So specific tax-efficiency techniques.  
  
1. Capital Loss Harvesting  
If the market goes down, that's a bad thing, right? Yes, but there's a silver lining. When you sell an asset at a loss, you can use that difference as a deductible on your tax return for up to $3000. It also rolls over to future years if you have more than the $3000 limit. There is one caveat: the wash rule, which prevents you from selling an asset when the market dips and rebuying it just to collect losses. The workaround is to, after selling, buy an asset that is different enough such that the IRS doesn't count it as a wash. "Different enough" means it tracks a different index or is distributed by a different company.  
  
2. Capital Gains Harvesting  
On the flip side, you can also harvest your capital gains. This means selling your investments, then rebuying them (they can be the same) to raise the cost basis of your assets, lessening your taxed gains when you sell them in the future. So say you have no income for the year. Your bracket before you start paying 15% on long-term capital gains is $39375, plus the $12200 standard deduction for single filers, totaling $51575. Let's say you have $5000 of taxable income left after withdrawing from other accounts before you enter that 15% bracket. You can look at your investments, sell some such that the gains you realize are close to $5000, rebuy them, and still not pay taxes. Then next year, when you're ready to sell them for good, you have $5000 less of capital gains to count towards your taxable income.  
  
3. Roth Conversion Ladder  
The idea of this one is to utilize money in your tax-advantaged retirement accounts before you hit 59.5 without paying the 10% penalty fee. The process has 3 steps:  
 a. After leaving your job, roll your 401k into your traditional IRA  
 b. When you have a low-income year, convert money in your traditional IRA to your Roth IRA  
 c. Wait 5 years, then withdraw  
The key is that you're choosing to pay taxes when you're in the lowest bracket possible. The first step, we all know, is common and you do not pay taxes on. In the second, the conversion amount is counted as taxable income. Thus, you can convert however much you can until you exhaust the $24400 standard deduction and not pay income taxes on the conversion (conversions to not count towards the $6000 IRA contribution limit). When the money is in your Roth account, you're still not home free - you must let the converted amount sit for 5 years before you can withdraw it penalty-free. That's why it's called a ladder: you will convert a little bit every year to use in the future, such that at year 5 you'll be using money from year 0, year 6 from year 1, and so on.  
  
Using these three techniques (and living a low-cost lifestyle), one can live off their various investment accounts while paying little to no taxes. Nothing described here is illegal; as the ChooseFI podcast likes to say, it's all about knowing the rules so you can win!
