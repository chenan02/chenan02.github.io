There are 5 5.12ds that I'd like to try (and hopefully send) before leaving the East Coast:  
Jesus Wept, RRG  
Triple Sec, RRG  
Slash and Burn, NRG  
Fruity Pants, NRG  
Welcome to Conditioning, NRG  

Probably listed in order of personal doableness. I hopped on Jesus Wept in October and was pleasantly suprised to find I could link most the moves on it. In contrast, FP and WtC both have cruxes of V5 and V6, neither of which I've been able to do off the ground.

A quick blurb about me:  
My body is build for endurance. Be it running or climbing, I've never been very "powerful". I can't hold a one-arm lockoff and boulder way softer than what I should be doing for what I lead, not that I lead that hard either. Therefore, I will focus my training this winter on power.

Other improvements I can make:  
- Keeping more weight on feet. Consciously relaxing my body on lead  
- Building momentum from my legs, not arms  
- Maintaining rhythm: I have a tendency to shake out forever on every jug I find  
- Strategizing clips: I also have a tendency to clip way above me, on a bad hold  

For notes on lead, I will record myself climbing and attempt to make goes better. I will also project more indoors, in order to better ingrain good technique.  
For power, I will incorporate limit bouldering and some campusing.
