Personal Finance 101  
  
There's a pretty good summary diagram of this post here: https://i.imgur.com/c0p24cU.png  
  
Never thought I'd be into tax laws and savings rates, but I guess that's what happens when you have too much time on your hands in your mid-20s.  
  
A couple weeks ago I stumbled on the concept of FIRE, or Financial Independence/Early Retirement. Apparently, there's a subset of people out there who like to scrounge for pennies saved in order to lop off a couple years of work.  
  
I think I found my people.  
  
Jokes aside, the idea is to live lean now to have the freedom to do what you want later. As someone who's already planning on taking intermittent gap years, that's a pretty powerful concept. Here are some pillars to make it happen.  
  
1. Live well below your means  
  
This is pretty obvious: a penny saved is a penny earned. But I also like to think of it like this:   
  
Alice and Bob both make $100,000/year. Alice lives in a nice apartment, eats out three times a week, and enjoys going out on the weekends. As such, she spends about $60,000/year. Bob lives in a modest apartment, cooks his meals, and stays in on the weekends, spending about $30,000/year.  
  
Bob can now take an entire year off (spending the same) and have spent the same amount as Alice!  
  
This concept of a "savings rate" (Bob's 70% vs Alice's 40%) is the magic number people in FIRE are always looking to maximize. Choosing a used, reliable car over a hotrod is not that hard. You're not gonna miss the space of the large apartment you don't rent. Once you get used to a more frugal lifestyle, it's not hard to keep it. Also, making a budget and knowing where your money goes is pretty invaluable.
  
2. Establish a 6 month emergency fund  
  
In a high-yield savings account. You never know when you have a medical emergency or need to take a trip on short notice.  
  
3. Pay back debt in order of highest interest
  
4. Invest in low-expense index funds  
  
The stock market is gonna go up. Sometimes it goes down. But I'm a data guy and the data says that for the past 200 years it has returned an average of 10% annually. That beats out your 1.7% high-yield savings accounts, which doesn't even beat the inflation rate of 2%. Think about that. Even if you think you're getting a good interest rate at your bank, you are literally LOSING that money if you don't put it to use!  
  
"Stocks are a gamble", you say? I agree. I'm never going to win against the algorithms and pro traders on Wall Street. But while individual stocks are a gamble, the market is not, which is why I invest in low-expense index funds.  
  
What are low-expense index funds. Basically, a company buys stocks in proportion to an index (i.e., the S&P 500, which are the 500 biggest companies traded publicly) and sells a piece of this pie. Because the company isn't doing any active trading to "beat" the market, they don't charge as much. Historically, active traders don't beat the market either, which is why these are fine.  
  
So which ones? There's tons of literature on this but online forums tend to go with the 3-fund portfolio. Essentially, you want your assets to be diverse, yet simple to manage. So it's suggested to buy three kinds of funds:  
  - Total US stock market  
  - Total Foreign stock market  
  - Total Bonds market
The percentage allocation varies on your risk tolerance, with more risky in the US, and less so heavier in bonds. Some people say your stock allocation should be 100%-{age}, and then usually 70/30 US-international. So for me it would be 100%-24 * .7 = 53.2% US stocks, 100%-24 * .3 = 22.8% Foreign stocks, and 24% bonds. I'm kinda a high roller so I have more in US stocks.  
  
5. Take advantage of tax-advantaged accounts  
  
It seems like taxes are the bane of the FIRE community. Like people have found all sorts of exploitations in the tax code, and I've heard of some early retirees who don't pay taxes at all. As someone who voted for Bernie in the last primary, I'm not sure if I agree with this ethically, but it can be done. Basically, tax-advantaged accounts like the 401k and IRAs are your friends - they're a way to let your investments grow without paying taxes on your gains. (As opposed to assets in a brokerage account, where you pay 20-30% on gains for stocks held less than a year and ~15% for those held over year) That's like getting getting a ~20% jump in your share prices right off the bat!  
  
So how to do this. They say you should put your money in the order of the following:  
  a. Contribute enough to your 401k to get the company match  
  b. Max out your IRA  
  c. Top out the 401k with to least 15%, or more if you're looking to take advantage of conversions (discussed in another post)  
And use that money to invest in low-expense index funds, as described above.
  
Roth or Traditional? There's so many debates on this. Roth means you fund the account with money already taxed at your current income level, Traditional means the money isn't taxed now but you will need to pay it at the bracket you'll be at when you retire. The math works out the same: you'll have a bigger seed to start with in traditional, but will pay a bigger tax because of that. Therefore, you can deduce that to be tax-efficient, you'd choose traditional if you think you'll make more now (and therefore at a lower bracket in retirement), vs traditional if you think you'll make more later. There are other arguments like tax rates rising and effective vs marginal tax rates but w/e. One thing to note, however, is that Roth is a little more flexible because you can withdraw CONTRIBUTIONS (not gains) at any time without penalty. 
  
What people in the FIRE community generally suggest is to have a traditional 401k (you'll be at the lowest tax bracket in early retirement) and a roth IRA (as that's what you'll end with, and if you have a 401k and earn enough then you can't make tIRA contributions deductible anyways). They'll also suggest you max out both.
