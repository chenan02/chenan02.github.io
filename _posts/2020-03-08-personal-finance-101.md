Personal Finance 101  
  
There's a pretty good summary diagram of this post here: https://i.imgur.com/c0p24cU.png  
  
Never thought I'd be into tax laws and savings rates, but I guess that's what happens when you have too much time on your hands in your mid-20s.  
  
A couple weeks ago I stumbled on the concept of FIRE, or Financial Independence/Early Retirement. Apparently, there's a subset of people out there who like to scrounge for pennies saved in order to lop off a couple years of work.  
  
I think I found my people.  
  
Jokes aside, the idea is to live lean now to have the freedom to do what you want later. As someone who's already planning on taking intermittent gap years, that's a pretty powerful concept. Here are some pillars to make it happen.  
  
1. Live well below your means  
  
This is pretty obvious: a penny saved is a penny earned. But I also like to think of it like this:   
  
Alice and Bob both make $100,000/year. Alice lives in a nice apartment, eats out three times a week, and enjoys going out on the weekends. As such, she spends about $60,000/year. Bob lives in a modest apartment, cooks his meals, and stays in on the weekends, spending about $30,000/year.  
  
Bob can now take an entire year off (spending the same) and have spent the same amount as Alice!  
  
This concept of a "savings rate" (Bob's 70% vs Alice's 40%) is the magic number people in FIRE are always looking to maximize. Choosing a used, reliable car over a hotrod is not that hard. You're not gonna miss the space of the large apartment you don't rent. Once you get used to a more frugal lifestyle, it's not hard to keep it. Also, making a budget and knowing where your money goes is pretty invaluable.
  
2. Establish a 6 month emergency fund  
  
In a high-yield savings account. You never know when you have a medical emergency or need to take a trip on short notice.  
  
3. Pay back debt in order of highest interest
  
4. Invest in low-expense index funds  
  
The stock market is gonna go up. Sometimes it goes down. But I'm a data guy and the data says that for the past 200 years it has returned an average of 10% annually. That beats out your 1.7% high-yield savings accounts, which doesn't even beat the inflation rate of 2%. Think about that. Even if you think you're getting a good interest rate at your bank, you are literally LOSING that money if you don't put it to use!  
  
"Stocks are a gamble", you say? I agree. I'm never going to win against the algorithms and pro traders on Wall Street. But while individual stocks are a gamble, the market is not, which is why I invest in low-expense index funds.  
  
What are low-expense index funds. Basically, a company buys stocks in proportion to an index (i.e., the S&P 500, which are the 500 biggest companies traded publicly) and sells a piece of this pie. Because the company isn't doing any active trading to "beat" the market, they don't charge as much. Historically, active traders don't beat the market either, which is why these are fine.  
  
So which ones? There's tons of literature on this but online forums tend to go with the 3-fund portfolio. Essentially, you want your assets to be diverse, yet simple to manage. So it's suggested to buy three kinds of funds:  
  - Total US stock market  
  - Total Foreign stock market  
  - Total Bonds market
The percentage allocation varies on your risk tolerance, with more risky in the US, and less so heavier in bonds. Some people say your stock allocation should be 100%-{age}, and then usually 70/30 US-international. So for me it would be 100%-24 * .7 = 53.2% US stocks, 100%-24 * .3 = 22.8% Foreign stocks, and 24% bonds. I'm kinda a high roller so I have more in US stocks.  
  
5. Take advantage of tax-advantaged accounts  
  
401k, Roth IRA, etc.
