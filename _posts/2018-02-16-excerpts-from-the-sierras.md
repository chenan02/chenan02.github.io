9 August 2017 - Big Springs Campground, CA
What the fuck was I doing here? Why did I think I could just roll in without a plan?  
[...]  
I take a nap. When I wake, I think logically: I am doing te exact same thing I would at home, only I have displaced myself: I am simply existing.  
[...]  
Naturally, this leads to all sorts of existential thoughts. Is the meaning of life simply to exist, meaning no meaning?  
[...]  
I realize the difference that caused my panic mode: I have not given my life meaning, here in the mountains. In "normal" life, I give myself objectives: earn money, fix a bug, meet a friend; the act of opening the computer and pulling up Facebook is an objective in itself. Here, my only objective is to live, which is to say I might as well be dead.  
  
And that's okay.

Mindset is so important on the trail. It keeps coming back to the idea of the "self-fulfilling prophecy" - if you think something's gonna be bad, it will be bad. [...] If I avoid such labeling and generally approach things with a positive mindset, life will be much better, self-fulfilling.

Under the stars, it was as Spencer put it - "Everything I always said I wanted to do but never did."

26 August 2017 - Muir Trail Ranch  
The key to happiness is trying to be happy. Happy thoughts will not come to you when you are sad; you will not smile when you are crying. You need to trick youself into happiness, making willing happy thoughts from nothing, and it will come. [...] Another instance of the self-fulfilling prophecy - it all depends on the mindset. It is so easy to indulge in negative thoughts - it's not worth it. Smile and remember - it is a choice to be happy, made by you & you only.

9/5/17 - Vogelsang Backpackers' Camp  
When She left, everything was silent. Oppressive, waiting for me to fold. I was scared. I've heard it before - when I first came to Mammoth, alone. And now I was to become comfortable w/ just myself, again. Back to square one.

9/8/17 - Glacier Point, Last night on the trail  
[...]  
I was so, so proud of myself, of who I've become  
[...]  
Because our actions make up who we are, and I decided, I cose, to be here, looking out on the Yosemite Valley, at the end of a 300 mile trail.  
  
So to me, being a man isn't about how old you are or what you know. It's about having found youself, and being damn proud of who you've become.  
[...]  
The journey doesnt end here; I hope to keep changing, to keep putting myself in unfamiliar situations to have experiances I otherwise would not have. But for now, where I am is fine by me.
