Thoughts on Training During Quarantine  
  
Well the apocalypse has come. A virus whose infected we can't see is sweeping across the land, and now we must wait for our impending doom inside... with nothing but our hangboards for company. Boohoo.  
  
New to this, I've been playing around with various protocols. Which should I use? Which is the best? It seems like every trainer and their mother is peddling their methods in these times.  
  
Spoiler alert: they all work. 
  
I think the important thing here is to not let perfect be the enemy of good. There's no "best" hangboard protocol. And even if you can't climb, any weighting on your fingers is better than nothing. So the worst thing you can do is sit in analysis paralysis and lose that precious time.  
  
The past couple months I've been trying whatever protocol speaks to me. And I've come up with a frankenstein of a program that, I think, is not bad. Behold:  
  
Andrew's Awesome Training Plan  
2 weeks hypertrophy - repeaters/density hangs (1010100 x2)  
4 weeks recruitment - max hangs/velocity pulls (alternate weeks btwn 4F and 2F - 100100)  
  
None of this is my original thinking. Repeaters were made popular by the RCTM, and if they've worked for Jonathan Siegrist then they'll work for me. Max hangs are championed by Eva Lopez, and recruitment/velocity pulls are newish from science man Tyler Nelson. I kind of combined them, one after another, to form a sort of complex exercise. Finally, I vary the grips just for fun.
  
In the end, these have all worked for other people. So they'll work for you.  

Other thoughts  
- I haven't had access to a gym, and honestly I've noticed a significant breakthrough in my exercises. After sitting around on my butt a couple weeks, suddenly I can do 10 seconds of a one-arm lockoff easily, when before I could barely do so with assistance. The key: REST IS IMPORTANT.  
  
- Following up with the above, I now see that my schedule before was insane and completely riddled with red flags that I had been blind to. I used to strength train mornings from Monday-Thursday, often for 2+ hours, then climb in the evening every other day. Why? Because I could. My body was "ok", as in feeling fine, but I couldn't see that it should be feeling BETTER. I think Hazel Findlay(?) once said that you should be feeling one step behind in your training, and time and time again I've proven that. 

- What I had done in the past might have its place in an alpine setting. Because I realize that by grinding my body down day after day, the adaptations that have come have really been around all-day capacity. I didn't realize it then, but there's a reason why 24 Hours of Horseshoe Hell felt easy to me. Because I've been (unknowinly) training for it for years. But that is not the goal I was aiming for. If I want to get better at short, intense sport routes, then I need to train in short, intense blocks with lots of rest.  
  
- Finally, I think too often I will workout when I'm sore just because "today is training day". There's a reason your body is telling you that: LISTEN TO IT! Just because the pros train as much as they do, doesn't mean you should. Because unless you've been conditioning your body since birth, you just don't have it. You're not the exception. Besides, you wouldn't train like an olympic weightlifter, would you?
